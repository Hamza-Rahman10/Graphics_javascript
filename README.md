Lab assessment:

3D cells may be represented and controlled in JavaScript using libraries such as Three.js, which makes it easier to interact with WebGL to produce 3D visuals in the browser. A 3D cell can be represented as a geometric shape, such as a cube or sphere, and then placed within a 3D coordinate system. Each cell can have dynamically changed attributes like as location, size, colour, and texture, allowing for the creation of interactive visualisations or simulations. For example, in a biological simulation, 3D cells might represent individual creatures or components of a bigger system, with JavaScript directing their behaviour and interactions.
Developers may use Three.js or similar tools to render these cells in a 3D environment, add lighting and shading, and allow for user interactions such as rotation and zooming. This method is frequently used in data visualisation, gaming, and educational applications to bring complicated 3D concepts to life in an understandable and entertaining manner.
